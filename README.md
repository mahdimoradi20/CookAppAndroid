# CookAppAndroid

This is the Android site of CookApp that users can use it to get a lot of food recipes.
I write this app with java but maybe i use Kotlin in future in some part of this app.  I will appreciate any contribution for the app from you.
android Cookapp also has a server side app for the admin that can use it in order to write recipes and send them to users.
You can also find that server side app in my github. that is being written by python flask.

This project have some config file search for GetConfigSample.java and put your host address and your api key there.

Sorry if my english was not good enough
thank you for reading this README file. :)
