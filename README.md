# CookAppAndroid

This is the Android site of CookApp that users can use it to get a lot of food recipes.
I write this app with java but maybe i use Kotlin in future in some part of this app.  I will appreciate any contribution for this app from you.
this app also has a server side app for the admin that can use it in order to write recipes and send them to users.
You can also find that server side app in my github. that is being written by python flask.

Sorry if my english was not good enough
thank you for reading this README file. :)
